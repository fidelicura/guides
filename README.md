# Info

There is a simple "instruction": all "projects" have their own set of tests and implementation details on the topic that follows from the folder name.
For self-study purposes.

I really try to give clear and simple explanations of each data structure.
Also, all Markdown files are fully compatible with [presenterm](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm), so try to use it!

>All examples are made **in** and **for** Rust.
